It is October 1st, 2018 and I am undergoing a new 30 day github challenge. For this I am going to learn how to develop games in Unreal Engine 4 using C++. 

### Day 1
I spent the entire time getting my rig set up. I thought I had already accomplished this but I was missing a tool set on my VS2017 and therefore spend over a half hour updating it. THEN, it needed to update again once the addition was complete. SO, I spend on hour reading docs. OFF TO A GOOD START!

### Day 2
Today was a little better, but I am feeling a bit overwhelmed. The tut moves hella fast and I am not sure I am really learning anything that will stick. Lets see... Today I created a base character class with C++. I also needed to work with some C-Sharp files but there was little explanation as to why. I also fiddled around in the Unreal Engine... Applying assets and learning how to manipulate them in their environment. I am going to stick with the learning resource until I have completed the tutorial and then re-evaluate from there. That is unless, it becomes completely unbareable. 

### Day 8
I haven't updated this file in the last 6 days but I've made a lot of progress so far. I am learning the syntax and architecture of C++ classes and am getting more comforatable with them by the day. Further, the game play of the game is coming along. I have created the playable character that can now move about the map, shoot their weapon, and has the beginings of a HUD. I am really digging this shit so far.

### Day 9
Tonight I finished implementing the code that allows the player to shoot their weapon. Along with that, I implemented an animation for when the weapon is fired. 


### Day 11
Over the last few days I created classes for the Generic HUD and gameplay HUD - Pause menu, death menu cross hairs and status bar. My understanding of C++ is improving s well. I still have  a long way to go on that regard but my ability obtread the code and understand t hais vastoy improved.

### Day 20
I haven't been keeping up with the README.md but that is ok. I'll give a quick update. So, I have a fully functioning character - they shoot, sprint, run out of ammo, die, etc. I have also implemented destructible items in my game - THEY EXPLODE! Today, I didn't write any code that I can commit to the Github, but I implemented the start game menu all with Blueprint Scripting. It was really quite simple... I am excited to play around with all of the options Unreal provides. I am curious has to house you could possibly use code to make a really unique and baller Menu - These are things I will study in between challenges... BTW, taht is my plan once this challenge is over... I am going to read over all of the code I have implemented in the 30 days and read over everything I did along with Unreals docs. I hope to really add valuable context to what I am been developing here in this tutorial.
