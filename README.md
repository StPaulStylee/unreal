It is October 1st, 2018 and I am undergoing a new 30 day github challenge. For this I am going to learn how to develop games in Unreal Engine 4 using C++. 

### Day 1
I spend the entire time getting my rig set up. I thought I had already accomplished this but I was missing a tool set on my VS2017 and therefore spend over a half hour updating it. THEN, it needed to update again once the addition was complete. SO, I spend on hour reading docs. OFF TO A GOOD START!
