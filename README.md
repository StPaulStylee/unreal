It is October 1st, 2018 and I am undergoing a new 30 day github challenge. For this I am going to learn how to develop games in Unreal Engine 4 using C++. 

### Day 1
I spent the entire time getting my rig set up. I thought I had already accomplished this but I was missing a tool set on my VS2017 and therefore spend over a half hour updating it. THEN, it needed to update again once the addition was complete. SO, I spend on hour reading docs. OFF TO A GOOD START!

### Day 2
Today was a little better, but I am feeling a bit overwhelmed. The tut moves hella fast and I am not sure I am really learning anything that will stick. Lets see... Today I created a base character class with C++. I also needed to work with some C-Sharp files but there was little explanation as to why. I also fiddled around in the Unreal Engine... Applying assets and learning how to manipulate them in their environment. I am going to stick with the learning resource until I have completed the tutorial and then re-evaluate from there. That is unless, it becomes completely unbareable. 

### Day 8
I haven't updated this file in the last 6 days but I've made a lot of progress so far. I am learning the syntax and architecture of C++ classes and am getting more comforatable with them by the day. Further, the game play of the game is coming along. I have created the playable character that can now move about the map, shoot their weapon, and has the beginings of a HUD. I am really digging this shit so far.
